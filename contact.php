            <p>Overall, we feel that having an easy-to-use contact form looks more professional and put together on a contact us page than just an email.

Think about it: When you really need to contact support, you're looking for immediate help. With a contact form, you can fill it out within seconds and click send.

Yet, with an email, you have to copy it, open up your email provider, paste it in the recipient field, and then type up your message. And, you might not have provided enough information to the company, which would require more back and forth emails until they're able to fully help. That's a pretty stressful situation.</p>
